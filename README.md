## React Chat Community
### Using Socket.io


This is the code from a tutorial done on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfUtdEcvGHFHdOYFXj4cY6ZIFkSp6MOuY).

### Getting Started

First you'll need to fork or download the respository.
```
git clone : https://github.com/Pramod0215/react-chat-community.git
```

Then in terminal you'll install the node modules

``` 
npm install 
```

Then you can run it using 

``` npm start ``` to start React dev server.
``` npm run server ``` to start NodeJS Socket.io server.
